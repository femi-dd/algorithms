An implementation of PHP's Openssl xtension, which allows the creation of public and private keys for a single use and encrypt/decrypt methods for basic simple.

A public and private key can be generated by passing $generate_new_keys as true when creating a new object:
```
$obj = new ASM(true);
```

which allows access to the following methods without throwing an exception.
```
$obj->getPublicKey();   // returns generated public key
$obj->getPrivateKey();  // returns generated private key
```

When needed to encrypt or decrypt data for an existing user, the constructor needs not be passed a value or can be passed the value of false, the keys which are fetched from wherever stored is then used to to crypt whatever needs to be crypted away.

```
$obj2 = new ASM();
$encrypted_data = $obj2->encrypt('Hello World!', $public_key);
$decrypted_data = $obj2->decrypt($encrypted_data, $private_key);
```
